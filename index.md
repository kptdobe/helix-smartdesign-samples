### Some stuff with lists ?

1. Try editing `index.md` and see what happens.
2. Try editing `src/html.htl` to change the HTML output
3. Try editing `src/static/style.css` to change the way this page looks

---

### And then?

1. Commit your changes: `git commit -a`
2. Publish your project to GitHub: `git add git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git && git push`
3. Deploy the project: `hlx deploy`
4. Make it visible to the world: `hlx strains`
